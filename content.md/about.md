A software developer, writer, musician, friendly neighborhood "radical leftist," (and parenthentically, someone striving to think, feel, and love like Jesus), from a place called Iowa, in the United States. If you've found your way to this blog, in the words of St. Fred Rogers, would "*you* be my neighbor?"
